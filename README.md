## Projects
### Blood-Cell Image Classification
[Blood Cell Classification Methods and Findings](blood_cell_classification.pdf)

Ideated and implemented an image processing pipeline in **Python** to extract novel feature vectors and perform dimensionality reduction for images of healthy blood cells. Built, trained, and compared performance  multiple simple and deep learning classification models using **TensorFlow**. Achieved 94% test accuracy.
