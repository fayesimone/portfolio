## Projects
### Blood-Cell Image Classification
[Blood Cell Classification Methods and Findings](Blood Cell Classification Methods and Findings.pdf)

Ideated and implemented an image processing pipeline to extract novel feature vectors and perform dimensionality reduction for images of healthy blood cells. Built multiple simple and deep learning classification models using **TensorFlow**. Achieved 94% test accuracy.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
